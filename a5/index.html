            <h3>Trips this Summer!</h3>
        <article>
            <p>Summer is approaching. The days are getting longer and the temperature is rising. I hope you're prepared for this summer, as it's shaping up to be one of the hottest on record. Take advantage of this summer and take that much deserved trip!</p>
            <h3>Importance of <em>Vacations</em></h3>
            <p>A 2010 study found more happiness comes from planning a vacation than taking the actual trip. The study, out of the Netherlands, looked at the happiness of more than 1,500 Dutch adults and learned that anticipating a vacation improved happiness for eight weeks. That’s definitely longer than most vacations.</p>
            <p>To get the most out of this effect, spend time thinking about your vacation ahead of time. If you’re someone who doesn’t enjoy the logistics of planning a trip, you can anticipate your trip by looking at photos or reading articles about your destination.</p>
            <p>Think about what you’re looking forward to on the vacation. Is it the food, the relaxation time, or the adventure? Let yourself daydream about sleeping in, taking time off work, and getting a break from the routine. Remember this is as important as the actual trip and allow yourself the joy of anticipation.</p>

            <h3>Friendly Pandemic Reminder ---</h3>
            <h3>The affect of the pandemic</h3>

            <p>COVID-19 has lingered since it's intial effect in June 2020 util now. A stay-at-home order and even a curfew was given. Some of us had to work from home, many were laid off, yet others were deemed necessary and had to return to regular employment. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a major effect on our everyday lives and activities. But don't let that deter you from getting up and going about your business as usual. Find time for yourself by getting up every morning, apply makeup, styling your hair, and reminding yourself of how wonderful you are. It's easy to lose track of even the most simplest things during this period. Be sure to find a way to stay on track. Dolls, I urge you to get up and put on some makeup! Feel like yourself once more and return to your original self! Finally, always wear a mask while going out, and if you're sick, see a doctor and stay at home!</p> 
            <p>Love yourself and stay safe, xoxo. </p>
